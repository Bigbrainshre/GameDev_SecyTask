This file contains details into how I made the assests, mechanics and sounds.

Code :

The code is completely original and is written by either just me or me looking up some functions from chatgpt.
      
Art : 

 The art is all "edited" I took a base sprite from the internet and changed the colour or made changes in the sprites, for example for the "Obstacle" sprite I choose a Sprite of a cactuss. Then I trippled it and changed it to lok natural.
 
Controls :

 'A' to go left, 'D' to go right and as soon as the objct hit another object it is able to move again. Also the ball can float in the air providing for some very cool obstcles.
 
Extra-Featues :

1. Dialogues to the Ghost in the Boss-Battle.
   
2. Different narrating voices which are fun to hear.

3. About page because why not.
   
This Drive link contains a folder with the final game build.
